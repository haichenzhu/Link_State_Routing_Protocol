firstly compile all java file
then, in 6 terminal windows execute the following command separately
java  Lsr A 5000 configA.txt 
java  Lsr B 5001 configB.txt 
java  Lsr C 5002 configC.txt 
java  Lsr D 5003 configD.txt 
java  Lsr E 5004 configE.txt
java  Lsr F 5005 configF.txt 

Now, the shortest path will be displayed in these terminal windows
for testing, shortdown some of these routers by $quit and check the outcomes
